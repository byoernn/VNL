# Setup a jsproject in vscode

Open the project folder *04-setup-jsproject* in vscode.
The `jsconfig.json` suggest that this is a js project.
- `"checkJs": true,` running a basic type check on js files.

 In `.vscode\settings.json` are more configurations that enable  
 to see types and variable names, checking strict mode and show references information. 

Under `app` you will find the `index.html` file and also the first `.css` and `.js` files.  
The `app` folder is the root of the web application.  
These files wil later be packed and delivered to our webserver.

I also added the first favicons to the app.  
The favicon is used as icon in shortcuts, the browser tab or  
on mobile devices if the app is added to the home screen and all this stuff.
