# A basic web page

You will find my code in [02-BasicPage](../src/02-BasicPage/).

There you can find a simple html file 'index.html'.  
HTML stands for Hyper Text markup language and is used to descripte the content and structure of a website.  
`<head> </head>` This area holds the metadata of the page.  
`<title> 02-BasicPage </title>` The title of the page that is shown in the tab of the browser. 
`<body> Hello World </body>` The content of the page.

Now we just need to right click on the index.html file and choose **open with Live Server**.  
Tada you will see `Hello World` in the browser.

Of course a web application will need some more stuff as this simple text.  
In the next chapter i will summarise the basics of html, css and js i always use or think are necessary.
