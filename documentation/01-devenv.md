# Development Environment

What you basically need, to start web developement, is a code editor and a web server.
As my code editor i decided to use [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com).

Normally you would use something like Apache Web Server or IIS(Internet Information Service) to host your web application.
For bringing your app into a production enviroment, i recommend to learn about how to host you webapp in one of these.

But for a development purpose we don't neet something this heavy.
We can use extension to make [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com) host our web application.
Herefor i decided to go with [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).

I can acces the marketplace for extension easily inside of [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com).  
To write these documentation i also use [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) in [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com).  
It brings a Markdown preview functionality.

As developer of course i need a version control system. Obviously i choose git.  
I needed to install the [git-scm](https://git-scm.com) in order to use the built-in git tools in vscode.

I think we are ready now to create our first project inside vscode.
