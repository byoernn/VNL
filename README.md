# VNL - Vanilla WebDevelopement

## Intro

Welcome to my journey where i try to gettig rid of frameworks when developing WebApps and hopefully finish with a set of methods to build good transitional apps.

I started thinking about this a while ago. In the previous days of web development everyone used jquery and some other nice js frameworks.
Then JS was able to do all the thing jquery did, so it became obsolet. Then Typescript appeared and i was full into it. 
But then today JS evolved into a nice programming language with features like arrow functions, classes, modules and so on. 
Then js types were also visible inside js editors, which are exactly the same as in typescript. 
When i am starting a project for a customer then for example we use angular and some ui framework. Then instead of wasting time to reinvent the weehl, i waste hours to learn a framework to let it do what i want.

A javascript code i wrote 10 years ago will work today as good as the day it was written, just some refactoring may be neccesary.
So here i am and thinking just get rid of it.

In the End i hope to provide a solid piece of documentation to help you and other developers.
